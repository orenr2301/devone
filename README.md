## Design
\\
 -let's talk Design First 


1. We Need to perform the Following:

    - Building Docker images, 
    
    - Writing the code for our app,
    
    - Using Terraform, and using a CI/CD to deploy our code more efficiently

    - The right idea is that we need to build and store images, then store files app related, and then make a single point that will host of docker containers and will be able to pull files from storage/repos for what we need.
